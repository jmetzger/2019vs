## 3. Performance Galera Cluster  

### 3a. RTT determines tps 

Good article on performance MaxScale 

https://severalnines.com/database-blog/improve-performance-galera-cluster-mysql-or-mariadb

as is:
tps restricted by RTT (Round Trip Time)

Quote ():
"[In a Galera cluster] a given row canâ€™t be modified more than once per RTT"

Hence, transactions per second can be estimated by dividing RTT (in second) into 1 second:

Minimum tps: 1 / 0.00134 (max RTT) = 746.26 ~ 746 tps
Average tps: 1 / 0.000431 (avg RTT) = 2320.19 ~ 2320 tps
Maximum tps: 1 / 0.000111 (min RTT) = 9009.01 ~ 9009 tps

Slowest node tears performance down.
